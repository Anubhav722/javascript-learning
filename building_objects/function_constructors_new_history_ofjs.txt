FUNCTION CONSTRUCTORS, 'new', AND THE HISTORY OF JAVASCRIPT

var obj = new Person() // yet another way to create objects




These are actually the right ways to create prototypes.
```
function Person() {
	console.log(this);
	this.firstName = "John";
	this.lastName = "Doe";
	console.log("This function is invoked"); 
}

var john = new Person(); // this function is getting invoked
console.log(john);
```

This is letting us construct an object via a function. We call a function that's used specifically to construct an object. (A function constructor)


FUNCTION CONSTRUCTORS:
A normal function that is used to construct objects.
The 'this` variable points to a new empty object, and that object is returned from the functio automatically.
The `new` operator makes the new object. And function constructors are used for adding properties and methods to that new object.
