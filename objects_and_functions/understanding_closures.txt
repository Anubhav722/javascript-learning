function that returns a function

```
function greet (whattosay) {
	return function (name) {
		console.log(whattosay + ' ' + name);
}
}
```


greet('Hi')('Tony');

we're invoking a function that returns a function, which we're are again invoking.

Even though the greet function ended, any functions created inside of it when they are called will still have a reference to that greet function memory to what was in it's memory, it's execution context memory space.
