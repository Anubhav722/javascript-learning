All objects in javascript have a prototype property. The property is simply a reference to another object. we call it `proto`.

```
var person = {
	firstName: 'Default',
	lastName: 'Default',
	getFullName: function () {
	return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;
	}
}


var john = {
	firstName: 'John',
	lastName: 'Doe'
}

// don't ever do this. For demo purpose only

john.__proto__ = person; // this is how inheritance is done.

console.log(john.getFullName());
```
it looks through every object `prototype chain` and works it's way down.

```
var jane = {
	firstName: 'Jane'
}
jane.__proto__ = person;
console.log(jane.getFullName());
```
