OR
Javascript is a single threaded language that can be non-blocking



WHAT IS A PROGRAM?
- Allocate memory
- parse and execute

JAVASCRIPT ENGINE
- memory heap
- call stack



Single threaded means that it has a only one call stack only one thing at a time. follow (first in last out)

stack overflow can happen due to memory heap being populated.

async:

setTimeout(() => {
	console.log('2');
}, 2000)
