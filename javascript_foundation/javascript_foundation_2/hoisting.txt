in global execution context creation phase we also have hoisting.

variables and functions are both hoisted.

i.e. even before creation of function definition we can call the function above this.

so javascript engine allocates memory variables and function that is sees in our code during the creation phase and before it executes it.

variables in javascript are partially hoisted. i.e. they are set to undefined before assignment.
functions are fully hoisted.

variable hoisting can only be done by using var and not by let or const.
