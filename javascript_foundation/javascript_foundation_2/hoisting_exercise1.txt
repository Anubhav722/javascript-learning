```
var favoriteFood = "grapes";

var foodThoughts = function (){
	console.log(favoriteFood);
	var favoriteFood = "sushi";
	console.log(favoriteFood);
}

foodThoughts()

```

The output would be:

```
undefined
sushi
```

From the example we understand that hoisting happens on every execution context.
Any time we run a function a new execution context gets created and we have to go through the creation phase and execution phase again
