Syntax PARSER
A program that reads your code and determines what it does and if its grammer is valid.
in this "a compiler"

LEXICAL ENVIRONMENT:
Where something sits physically in the code you write.

Lexical means having to do with words or grammer. A lexical environment exists in programming languages in which where you write something is important.
For example a variable inside a function.

EXECUTION CONTEXT:
A wrapper to help manage the code that is running
There are lots of lexical environments. Which one is currently running is managed via execution contexts. It can contain things beyond what you've written in your code.
